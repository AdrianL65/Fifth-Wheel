# Fifth-Wheel

The equipment used for this project consist of an electric scooter brushless motor wheel; a motorbike driver, LEDs, a potentiometer, a microcontroller (KL25Z),  
My main role in this project was to program the microcontroller (KL25Z) to actuate the velocity of the electric motor and control the signaling LEDs in the control panel. Regarding the microcontroller’s inputs, the system counts with a battery consumption sensory circuit, a potentiometer (for velocity control), a temperature sensor (for the driver’s safety), additionally the motor has a built in encoder that the microcontroller can process to compare the current speed to the wanted speed and act accordingly. My second role was the design of the user’s control panel as well as the 3D printing process.
