# Fifth-Wheel

My main role in this project was to program the microcontroller (KL25Z) to actuate the velocity of the electrical wheel and control the signaling LED’s. Regarding the inputs to the microcontroller, the system counts with a battery consumption sensory circuit, a potentiometer (for velocity control) and a temperature sensor (for the driver’s safety). My second role was the design of the user’s control panel as well as the 3D printing process.
